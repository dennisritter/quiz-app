        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": " Spot Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that are available at a discounted price compared to On- Demand pricing. Spot Instances use spare EC2 capacity that is not being used by other customers, and the price fluctuates based on supply and demand. Customers can request Spot Instances for their applications and specify the maximum price they are willing to pay per hour. If the Spot price is lower than the customer's bid, the Spot Instance is launched and the customer pays the current Spot price. However, if the Spot price rises above the customer's bid, the Spot Instance is terminated by AWS and the customer is charged for the partial hour of usage. Therefore, Spot Instances can provide discounts of up to 90% or more, but they are not suitable for applications that require continuous or predictable availability. Spot Instances are recommended for applications that are flexible, fault- tolerant, or have low priority, such as batch processing, data analysis, or testing and development. "

        "answer": "A",

Configuring an Application Load Balancer and assigning the EC2 instance as the ALB's target is a way to distribute traffic among multiple instances, but it does not make the application highly available if there is only one instance. Using an Amazon Machine Image to create the EC2 instance is a way to launch a virtual server with a preconfigured operating system and software, but it does not make the application highly available by itself. Provisioning the application by using an EC2 Spot Instance is a way to use spare EC2 capacity at up to 90% off the On-Demand price, but it does not make the application highly available, as Spot Instances can be interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute notification.

Security groups are virtual firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic for one or more instances. Customers can create security groups and add rules that reflect the role of the instance that is associated with the security group. For example, a web server instance needs security group rules that allow inbound HTTP and HTTPS access, while a database instance needs rules that allow access for the type of database12. Security groups are stateful, meaning that the responses to allowed inbound traffic are also allowed, regardless of the outbound rules1. Customers can assign multiple security groups to an instance, and the rules from each security group are effectively aggregated to create one set of rules1. Network ACLs are another AWS service or feature that can be used to control the traffic for a subnet. Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that they do not track the traffic that they allow. Therefore, customers must add rules for both inbound and outbound traffic3. Network ACLs are applied at the subnet level, not at the instance level.

You can learn more about Amazon EC2 pricing from this page. The other options are incorrect because: EC2 does not include operating system patch management. You are responsible for managing and maintaining your own operating systems on EC2 instances. You can use AWS Systems Manager to automate common maintenance tasks, such as applying patches, or use Amazon EC2 Image Builder to create and maintain secure images. Therefore, the incorrect answer is A. EC2 does not have a 100% service level agreement (SLA). The EC2 SLA guarantees 99.99% availability for each EC2 Region, not for each individual instance. Therefore, the incorrect answer is C. EC2 does not have automatic storage cost optimization. You are responsible for choosing the right storage option for your EC2 instances, such as Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) or Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), and monitoring and optimizing your storage costs. You can use AWS Cost Explorer or AWS Trusted Advisor to analyze and reduce your storage spending. Therefore, the incorrect answer is E. "

        "explanation": " The AWS service that will meet the requirements of the company that needs to host a highly available application in the AWS Cloud that runs infrequently for short periods of time with the least amount of operational overhead is AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows customers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. The company can use AWS Lambda to create and deploy their application as functions that are triggered by events, such as API calls, messages, or schedules. AWS Lambda automatically scales the compute resources based on the demand, and customers only pay for the compute time they consume. AWS Lambda also simplifies the management and maintenance of the application, as customers do not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure, security, or availability. Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Aurora are not the best services to use for this purpose. Amazon EC2 is a service that provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud, and allows customers to launch and run virtual servers, called instances, with a variety of operating systems, configurations, and specifications. Amazon EC2 requires customers to provision and manage the instances, and pay for the instance hours they use, regardless of the application usage. AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows customers to run containerized applications without managing servers or clusters. AWS Fargate requires customers to specify the amount of CPU and memory resources for each container, and pay for the resources they allocate, regardless of the application usage.

The other options are not suitable for the social media company's requirements, because: Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. However, Amazon Inspector does not provide a web application firewall service that can block malicious web requests3. Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3. Amazon GuardDuty analyzes and processes the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. However, Amazon GuardDuty does not provide a web application firewall service that can block malicious web requests4. Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. Amazon CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, and visualizes it using automated dashboards, alarms, and notifications.

Data encryption is the process of transforming data into an unreadable format that can only be accessed with a key or a password. The customer must decide whether to encrypt their data at rest (when it is stored on AWS) or in transit (when it is moving between AWS and the customer or between AWS services). The customer must also choose the encryption method, algorithm, and key management solution that best suit their needs. AWS provides various services and features that support data encryption, such as AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), and AWS Encryption SDK5 IAM users are entities that represent the people or applications that interact with AWS resources and services. The customer must grant the IAM users the minimum permissions that they need to perform their tasks, and avoid giving them unnecessary or excessive access. This is known as the principle of least privilege, and it helps reduce the risk of unauthorized or malicious actions. The customer can use IAM policies, roles, groups, and permissions boundaries to manage the access of IAM users. "

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": " The cost of application software licenses is the company's direct responsibility when it migrates its IT infrastructure from an on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud. Application software licenses are the agreements that grant users the right to use specific software products, such as operating systems, databases, or applications. Depending on the type and terms of the license, users may need to pay a fee to the software vendor or provider to use the software legally and access its features and updates. When users migrate their IT infrastructure to the AWS Cloud, they can choose to buy new licenses from AWS, bring their own licenses (BYOL), or use a combination of both. However, regardless of the option they choose, they are still responsible for complying with the license terms and paying the license fees to the software vendor or provider. AWS does not charge users for the application software licenses they bring or buy, but only for the AWS resources they use to run their applications. Therefore, the cost of application software licenses is the only cost among the options that is the company's direct responsibility. The other costs are either included in the AWS service fees or covered by AWS.

IAM roles allow customers to assign permissions to entities without having to create or manage IAM users or credentials for them. IAM roles can be assumed by different entities depending on the trust policy attached to the role. For example, IAM roles can be assumed by IAM users in the same or different AWS accounts, AWS services such as EC2 or Lambda, or external identities such as federated users or web identities. IAM roles can also be switched by IAM users to temporarily change their permissions. IAM roles are recommended for managing permissions for employees who often change teams, because they allow customers to define permissions based on job roles and responsibilities, and easily assign or revoke them as needed. IAM roles also reduce the operational overhead of creating, updating, or deleting IAM users or credentials for each employee or team change. "

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": " The benefit of the AWS Cloud that helps companies achieve lower usage costs because of the aggregate usage of all AWS users is economies of scale. Economies of scale means that AWS can achieve lower costs and higher efficiency by operating at a massive scale and passing the savings to the customers. AWS leverages the aggregate usage of all AWS users to negotiate better prices with hardware vendors, optimize power consumption, and improve operational processes. As a result, AWS can offer lower and more flexible pricing options to the customers, such as pay-as-you-go, reserved, and spot pricing models. No need to guess capacity, ability to go global in minutes, and increased speed and agility are other benefits of the AWS Cloud, but they are not directly related to the aggregate usage of all AWS users. No need to guess capacity means that AWS customers can avoid the risk of over-provisioning or under-provisioning resources, and scale up or down as needed. Ability to go global in minutes means that AWS customers can deploy their applications and data in multiple regions around the world, and deliver them to users with high performance and availability.

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, events, and alarms for your AWS resources and applications. Amazon CloudWatch alarms are actions that you can configure to send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define67. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is a service that helps you maintain application availability and allows you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to definable conditions. You can create dynamic scaling policies that track a specific CloudWatch metric, such as CPU utilization, and define what action to take when the associated CloudWatch alarm is in ALARM. When the policy is in effect, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling adjusts the group's desired capacity up or down when the threshold of an alarm is breached89.

S3 bucket policies are access policies that can be attached to Amazon S3 buckets to grant or deny permissions to the bucket and the objects it contains. S3 bucket policies can be used to control who has permission to read, write, or delete objects that the company stores in the S3 bucket. IAM user policies are access policies that can be attached to IAM users to grant or deny permissions to AWS resources and actions. IAM user policies can be used to control who has permission to read, write, or delete objects that the company stores in the S3 bucket. The other options are incorrect because they are not AWS features that will meet the requirements. Security groups and network ACLs are AWS features that act as firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from Amazon EC2 instances and subnets. Security groups and network ACLs do not control who has permission to read, write, or delete objects that the company stores in the S3 bucket.

        ],
        "answer": "A,E",
        "explanation": ",E The security best practices that should be followed are A and E. A). Grant the developer access to only the AWS resources needed to perform the job. This is an example of the principle of least privilege, which means giving the minimum permissions necessary to achieve a task. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, or accidental damage to AWS resources. You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create users, groups, roles, and policies that grant fine-grained access to AWS resources12. E). Ensure the account password policy requires a minimum length. This is a basic security measure that helps prevent brute-force attacks or guessing of passwords. A longer password is harder to crack than a shorter one. You can use IAM to configure a password policy that enforces a minimum password length, as well as other requirements such as complexity, expiration, and history34. B). Share the AWS account root user credentials with the developer. This is a bad practice that should be avoided. The root user has full access to all AWS resources and services, and can perform sensitive actions such as changing billing information, closing the account, or deleting all resources. Sharing the root user credentials exposes your account to potential compromise or misuse. You should never share your root user credentials with anyone, and use them only for account administration tasks5 . C). Add the developer to the administrator's group in IAM. This is also a bad practice that should be avoided."

        "explanation": " Security groups are the service or feature that meets the requirement of establishing a security layer in a VPC that will act as a firewall to control subnet traffic. Security groups are stateful firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. You can assign one or more security groups to each instance in a VPC, and specify the rules that allow or deny traffic based on the protocol, port, and source or destination. Security groups are associated with network interfaces, and therefore apply to all the instances in the subnets that use those network interfaces. Routing tables are used to direct traffic between subnets and gateways, not to filter traffic. Network ACLs are stateless firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level, but they are less granular and more cumbersome to manage than security groups. Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors your AWS account and workloads for malicious or unauthorized activity, not a firewall service. "

It is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that were used to create the account1. The root user should be protected and used only for a few account and service management tasks that require it1. Therefore, the following actions are best practices for an AWS account root user: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the root user. MFA is a security feature that requires users to provide two or more pieces of information to authenticate themselves, such as a password and a code from a device. MFA adds an extra layer of protection for the root user credentials, which can access sensitive information and perform critical operations in the account2. Create an IAM user with administrator privileges for daily administrative tasks, instead of using the root user. IAM is a service that helps customers manage access to AWS resources for users and groups. Customers can create IAM users and assign them permissions to perform specific tasks on specific resources. Customers can also create IAM roles and policies to delegate access to other AWS services or external entities3.

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": " On-Demand Instances are the most cost-efficient pricing model for an uninterruptible workload that runs once a year for 24 hours. On-Demand Instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second, depending on which instances you run. No long-term commitments or up-front payments are required. You can increase or decrease your compute capacity to meet the demands of your application and only pay the specified hourly rates for the instance you use1. This model is suitable for developing/testing applications with short-term or unpredictable workloads2. The other pricing models are not cost-efficient for this use case. Reserved Instances and Savings Plans require a commitment to a consistent amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years. They provide significant discounts compared to On-Demand Instances, but they are not flexible or scalable for workloads that run only once a year12. Spot Instances are the cheapest option, but they are not suitable for uninterruptible workloads, as they can be reclaimed by AWS at any time. They are recommended for applications that have flexible start and end times, or that are only feasible at very low compute prices12. Dedicated Instances are designed for compliance and licensing requirements, not for cost optimization. They are more expensive than the other options, as they run on single-tenant hardware12.

        "answer": "C,D",
        "explanation": ",D Using AWS Artifact to access AWS documents about the compliance of the services, and getting the compliance of the application certified by a company assessor are actions that the company should take to meet the requirements of complying with credit card regulatory requirements. AWS Artifact is a service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements. Reports available in AWS Artifact include our Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls. AWS Artifact can help you demonstrate compliance with credit card regulatory requirements by providing you with proof that the AWS services and deployment are in compliance. Getting the compliance of the application certified by a company assessor is an action that the company should take to ensure that the application meets the specific requirements of the credit card industry. A company assessor is an independent third-party entity that is qualified to assess the compliance of the application with the relevant standards and regulations. Using Amazon Inspector to submit the application for certification is not an action that the company should take, because Amazon Inspector is a service that helps you improve the security and compliance of your applications deployed on AWS by automatically assessing them for vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices, but it does not provide certification for the applications. Ensuring that the application's underlying hardware components comply with requirements is not an action that the company should take, because the application is deployed on AWS, and AWS is responsible for the security and compliance of the underlying hardware components. This is part of the shared responsibility model, where AWS is responsible for security of the cloud, and customers are responsible for security in the cloud.

            "D. Amazon EC2"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": " AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that enables you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk supports several platform configurations for Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker web applications that can run on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. You can also use Elastic Beanstalk to launch a virtual machine (VM) and MySQL database on AWS with the least operational effort. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that enables you to easily run, scale, and secure Docker containerized applications on AWS. However, it requires more operational effort than Elastic Beanstalk, as you need to define your application architecture and the specifications of the containers that run it. Amazon Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers everything you need to build an application or website, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan. It is designed for developers who have little or no prior cloud experience and want to launch and manage applications on AWS with minimal complexity. However, it does not support MySQL databases, and it requires more operational effort than Elastic Beanstalk, as you need to configure your VM and database settings. Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to launch a virtual machine (VM) and MySQL database on AWS, but it requires the most operational effort, as you need to provision, monitor, and manage your EC2 instances and database. "

            "D. Deploy Aurora Replicas."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": " The solution that meets the requirement of the company that runs a database on Amazon Aurora in the us-east-1 Region and has a disaster recovery requirement that the database be available in another Region with minimal disruption to the database operations is to deploy Aurora cross-Region read replicas. Aurora cross-Region read replicas are secondary Aurora clusters that are created in a different AWS Region from the primary Aurora cluster, and are kept in sync with the primary cluster using physical replication. The company can use Aurora cross-Region read replicas to improve the availability and durability of the database, as well as to reduce the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in case of a regional disaster. Performing an Aurora Multi-AZ deployment, creating Amazon EBS volume snapshots for Aurora and copying them to another Region, and deploying Aurora Replicas are not the best solutions for this requirement. An Aurora Multi-AZ deployment is a configuration that creates one or more Aurora Replicas within the same AWS Region as the primary Aurora cluster, and provides automatic failover in case of an Availability Zone outage. However, this does not provide cross-Region disaster recovery. Creating Amazon EBS volume snapshots for Aurora and copying them to another Region is a manual process that requires stopping the database, creating the snapshots, copying them to the target Region, and restoring them to a new Aurora cluster. This process can cause significant downtime and data loss. Deploying Aurora Replicas is a configuration that creates one or more secondary Aurora clusters within the same AWS Region as the primary Aurora cluster, and provides read scaling and high availability. However, this does not provide cross-Region disaster recovery."

This means that AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud, such as the global network, the hardware, the software, and the facilities. The customer is responsible for properly configuring the security of the provided service, such as the guest operating system, the application software, the data, and the network traffic. For abstracted services, such as Amazon RDS, AWS operates the infrastructure layer, the operating system, and the database software, while the customer is responsible for managing their data, classifying their assets, and using IAM tools to apply the appropriate permissions12. Therefore, the tasks that are the customer's responsibility are: Perform client-side data encryption: The customer is responsible for encrypting their data before sending it to AWS, and decrypting it after receiving it from AWS. This ensures that the data is protected in transit and at rest. AWS provides various encryption options, such as AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), AWS CloudHSM, and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)3. Configure IAM credentials: The customer is responsible for creating and managing IAM users, groups, roles, and policies that control the access to AWS resources and services. IAM credentials include user names, passwords, access keys, and permissions4. The tasks that are not the customer's responsibility are: Establish the global infrastructure: AWS is responsible for building and maintaining the global network of regions, availability zones, and edge locations that provide low latency, high availability, and fault tolerance for the AWS Cloud5. Secure edge locations: AWS is responsible for protecting the physical security of the edge locations, which are sites that deliver cached content to end users with improved performance6.
